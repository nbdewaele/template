This app has no Heroku address.  When started, this is how it need to be pushed.
$ rails test
$ git push heroku
$ heroku pg:reset DATABASE
$ heroku run rails db:migrate
$ heroku run rails db:seed
$ heroku restart

Considerations:
1. SSL certificate for your domain - for now piggy back on Heroku's
2. Database migrations
